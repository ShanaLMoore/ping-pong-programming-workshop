# Use Ping-Pong Programming (PPP) principles to build out the following functionality for a Calculator. 
# Here are the required methods:
# add
# subtract
# multiply
# dividie
# modulo
# square
# square root
# factorial

# To get you started, we've already started to implement the spec for #add per the PPP Workshop demo.
# With your PPP partner(s), start by running the specs, watch them fail, then 
# write the code to make them pass, incrementally. 
# Then move onto implementing the other specs and code for the methods listed above, per the PPP principles.
# Don't forget to think about any edge cases. (HINT for division - what should the user expect when they divide by zero?)
