# Use PPP principles to build out the following functionality for a Calculator. 
# Here are the requirements:
# add
# subtract
# multiply
# dividie
# modulo
# square
# square root
# factorial

# We've already started to implement the add spec in demo.
# With your PPP partner(s), start by running the specs, watch them fail, then 
# write the code to make them pass. Then move onto implementing the other
# methods (listed above) per the PPP principles and don't forget to think about
# any edge cases. (HINT for division - what should the user expect when they divide by zero?)
