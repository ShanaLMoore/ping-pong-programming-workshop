## Remote Collaboration Tools
Everyone should at least install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) + Vs Code's [Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share). It's free. 

Optional: also have [Tuple](https://tuple.app/) installed; it is costs money and is currently only available for macs. (It's the Scientist.com Software Services' team preferred remote pairing tool.)
